<p>The assertive, as it was called by  Bob Oswalt, is special kind of verb in Kashaya. It has a minimal or &quot;defective&quot; size, consisting solely of the consonant /ʔ/. It is probably derived historically from the verb stem /ʔi-/ meaning &quot;be&quot;. Like that verb, it can be followed by suffixes, but only a restricted set. Because it is not a full verb, it behaves as a <a class="gloss" href="glossary.html#clitic" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">clitic</a> and interacts with the preceding word.</p>
<p>The assertive can occur as /ʔ/ at the end of an utterance, where it has the meaning &quot;is, are&quot;, or can simply emphasize the truth of an assertion (which gives it this name).</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>balay | balay<span>ʔ</span></b><br>
  <i>blood | it is blood</i></li>

  <li><b>mu qʼóʔdi  <span>ʔ</span></b><br>
  <i>he is good</i> </li>
</ul>
<p>If the assertive follows a sonorant consonant, it will combine with it to make a glottalized sound. After a stop, it creates an ejective.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>balay | balay<span>ʔ</span></b><br>
    <i>blood | it is blood</i></li>
  <li><b>muʔtʼaw | muʔtʼaw<span>ʔ</span></b><br>
    <i>to be cooked | it is cooked</i></li>
  <li><b>šeʔeʔ | šeʔet<span>ʼ</span></b><br>
  <i>a basket | it's a basket</i></li>
  <li><b>simaʔ | simak<span>ʼ</span></b><br>
    <i>to fall asleep | he (did) fall asleep</i></li>
</ul>
<p>More often, the assertive occurs in the middle of a sentence as part of the <a href="copula.html">copula</a> /ʔe·/.</p>
<p>Between consonants, the /ʔ/ is realized as /i/. This situation arises only when the assertive has a suffix that starts with a consonant, and also is placed after a word that ends in a consonant. A common example is the quotative evidential /-do/, which is typical of storytelling. The sequence /ʔ-do/ can occur after any part of the sentence that is emphasized, but often it is simply found near the beginning of the sentence.</p><ul>
  <li><b>mi· ṭʼo  <span>ʔdo</span> ʔahša baṭʰé· mu·kinʔ duqʰayá·duce·du</b><br>
  <i>they say he catches a lot of fish there</i></li>

  <li><b>ʔama· šóʔ tʰin <span>ido</span> mu duwi</b><br>
    <i>Coyote didn't pay attention, they say</i></li>
  <li><b>qʰaʔbe ʔácaʔ yac<span>ʼ ido</span> ṭʼí· šiʔba tol qʰaʔbe </b><br>
  <i>Rock Man's body was all rock (they say</i>)</li>
</ul>
