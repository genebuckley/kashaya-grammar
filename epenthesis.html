<p>Epenthesis is the insertion of a vowel, usually to help with pronunciation. In Kashaya, it occurs when there are too many consonants<i></i> in a row. </p>
<p>Usually the epenthetic vowel is /i/, but after /m/ and /q/ the vowel is /a/. </p>
<p>A good example is the semelfactive, which is -c but has an extra /i/ vowel when it occurs after a consonant, as in /ṭʰaʔbam-c-/ &quot;appear&quot; that becomes  /ṭʰaʔbam-ci-/. With the essive, the epenthetic vowel is /a/, since it occurs after /m/, as in /pʰaʔsʼaṭʰ-m-/ &quot;slap&quot; becoming /pʰaʔsʼaṭʰ-ma-/. You can see epenthesis also in some verb plurals, such as /pʰanem-/ &quot;hit&quot; which forms the plural by putting /t/ before that final consonant; this makes /pʰanetʰm-/, but to make it easier to pronounced the second consonant, epenthesis gives us /pʰanetʰma-/.</p>
