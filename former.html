<p>This element indicates that something happened, or was true, in the past. It is a <a class="gloss" href="glossary.html#clitic" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">clitic</a> that occurs after the word or phrase that it modifies. When it occurs after a noun, it can usually be translated as &quot;former&quot;, or sometimes &quot;which was mentioned previously&quot;. </p>
<h3>Pronunciation</h3>
<p>After a vowel, it has the shape /<b>ʔyow</b>/.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>hiʔdá <span>ʔyow</span></b><br>
    <i>the former road</i> (which is not there anymore) </li>
  <li><b>naṭá yya <span>ʔyow</span></b><br>
  <i>the former children</i> (who have now grown up)</li>
</ul>
<p>Following a consonant, this clitic takes the form /<b>iyow</b>/. More precisely, an <a class="gloss" href="glossary.html#epenthesis" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">epenthetic</a> vowel /i/ is inserted, and the /ʔ/ combines with the preceding consonant. If that consonant is a plain stop, then it becomes an <a class="gloss" href="glossary.html#ejective" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">ejective</a> stop. (In addition, /soh/ &quot;just&quot; becomes /sokʼ/ in this environment.) Otherwise, the /ʔ/ disappears. </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>qʰaʔbeqʰácʼ <span>iyow</span></b><br>
    <i>the former sharp-skinned hawk</i> (that has been transformed)</li>
  <li><b>sokʼ <span>íyow</span></b><br>
    <i>it was nothing</i></li>
  <li><b>duwení ṭʼo ʔama· cʼíškan <span>iyow</span></b><br>
    <i>the old days were wonderful</i></li>
</ul>
<p>This alternation in pronunciation occurs in all the different contexts of use described below, where more examples are provided.</p>
<h3>Occurrence with a suffix</h3>
<p>This clitic usually occurs with another suffix. It is followed by /-<b>am</b>/, or less often /-<b>amu</b>/, if the word or phrase is the subject of a sentence or serves an <a class="gloss" href="glossary.html#agent" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">agent</a> role.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>ʔima·tá <span>ʔyowam</span> cʰoyiʔ miṭiw</b><br>
    <i>the former woman was lying dead (on the ground)</i></li>
  <li><b>bihše <span>ʔyowam</span> ʔacaʔ cícʼbina</b><br>
    <i>the former deer had turned into a person</i></li>
  <li><b>kumíʔdaʔ ʔa ma·dal <span>iyowam</span> qʰamací·duwa·duce·du</b><br>
    <i>I used to accompany her all the time</i></li>
</ul>
<p>It is followed by /-<b>al</b>/ if the word or phrase is the object of a verb or postposition, or serves a <a class="gloss" href="glossary.html#patient" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">patient</a> role, or is possessed by someone.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>qaʔdí <span>ʔyowal</span> ṭʼi cʰitʼošcíhqaqʰ</b><br>
    <i>(someone) must have cut down all the grass that was previously there</i></li>
  <li><b>kuhnú <span>ʔyowal</span> pʰala mihyáʔ mul</b><br>
    <i>(he) won back those already-mentioned beads</i></li>
  <li><b>ʔima·ta náṭa <span>ʔyowal</span> ʔihyumciw</b><br>
    <i>the former girl became cold</i></li>
  <li><b>pʰiʔtʼan ʔacacʼ <span>íyowal</span> cʰoyiʔ</b><br>
    <i>that former man suddenly died</i></li>
  <li><b>heʔé <span>ʔyowal</span> pʰalá ʔbaʔ mu·kito</b><br>
    <i>his former hair grew back</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The /ʔ/ element that starts this clitic is the <a class="gloss" href="glossary.html#assertive" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">assertive</a>, a special type of verb. As a result, the clitic is often marked with the Non-Final Verb suffix /-<b>e·</b>/ when other words follow in the same sentence.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>mací <span>ʔyowe·</span> mu</b><br>
    <i>it was daylight</i></li>
  <li><b>mi·li qán <span>iyowe·</span> ʔa wa·du</b><br>
    <i>this is where I came through</i></li>
  <li><b>muʔnati <span>ʔyowe·</span> ʔa yów hcedu</b><br>
    <i>but I said &quot;all right&quot;</i></li>
  <li><b>ku·yí <span>ʔyowe·</span> ya ʔahqʰa mála· ṭʰahqawem</b><br>
    <i>once while we were playing by the water...</i></li>
</ul>
<p>It might be the case that these instances are actually from a more complex sequence including the copula, /ʔyow ʔe·/, but the pronunciation is the same because the second /ʔ/ is deleted.</p>
<h3>Usage after a verb</h3>
<p>The clitic can occur after an absolutive verb, where it emphasizes that something happened in the past; it can sometimes be translated &quot;previously&quot; or "used to (be or do something)". The form of the clitic follows the usual rules, so it is /<b>ʔyow</b>/ after /-u/, for /d/-final stems.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>men tʼá·du <span>ʔyowe·</span> to pʰala</b><br>
    <i>I felt the same way too</i></li>
  <li><b>mu·kinʔ ʔamatol miṭicí·du <span>ʔyowam</span></b><br>
    <i>he used to lie on the ground</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise the clitic is /<b>iyow</b>/ after consonants, including the /-w/ form of the absolutive. </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>ʔacaʔ nohpʰow <span>íyowal</span> i ṭʼi·</b><br>
    <i>where all the Indians had been living</i></li>
  <li><b>to naʔbacá·law <span>iyow</span></b><br>
    <i>he used to lie on the ground</i></li>
  <li><b>cʰow <span>íyow</span> em ṭʼo mu·kinʔ bé·li ʔa wa·du meʔ</b><br>
    <i>he wasn't here when I came</i></li>
</ul>
<p>With other consonants, the absolutive is /-ʔ/, but this glottal stop is deleted. If the remaining verb-final consonant is a stop, it will become an ejective.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>qʼoʔdi šocam <span>íyowe·</span> ma</b><br>
    <i>you used to listen well</i></li>
  <li><b>qom <span>íyowe·</span> mu·kinʔ</b><br>
    <i>he took a bath</i></li>
  <li><b>bahnatʼ <span>íyow</span></b><br>
    <i>asked previously</i></li>
</ul>
Sometimes this element occurs after a particular word in the sentence other than the verb, but still conveys a general past tense meaning for the entire sentence.
<ul>
  <li><b>ʔama báʔtʼa <span>ʔyowam</span> ʔa qawi ʔin</b><br>
    <i>I used to be slow, when I was young</i></li>
  <li><b>ʔama tol maʔyul <span>iyowam</span> mu kʰe ʔa·tʰénʔ šokonʔwadu·cedu</b><br>
    <i>my mother always used to sit around on the floor</i></li>
</ul>
