<p>This page give brief definitions of terms that may be helpful in understanding descriptions of Kashaya.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="abecedary"></a> <b>Absolutive</b>. An important form of the verb in Kashaya, the one generally used when someone asks &quot;how do you say...?&quot; It serves as the infinitive, and has many other uses. It takes the forms <b>-w</b>, <b>-u</b>, <b>-ʔ</b>. <a target="_blank" href="absolutive.html">↗️</a></p>
<p><a name="affricate" id="affricate"></a> <b>Affricate</b>. A sound
  that is a combination of a stop and fricative, such as English <i>ch</i> which is phonetically the stop <i>t</i> plus the fricative <i>sh.</i> In Kashaya, <b>c cʰ cʼ</b> are  affricates. <a target="_blank" href="sounds.html">↗️</a></p>
<p><a name="agent"></a> <b>Agent</b>. A participant who is seen as being in control of a situation, or acting with intention, as in <i><span>We</span> stood up</i>, or <i><span>She</span></i> <i>kicked me</i>. In Kashaya, this role may be marked by the clitic <b>ʔem</b>. Compare <a href="#patient" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">patient</a>. <a target="_blank" href="agent.html">↗️</a></p>
<p><a name="aspirated"></a> <b>Aspirated</b>. Said of a sound pronounced with a puff of air at the release. Example: English <i>p</i> is aspirated [p&#688;] in <i>pay</i>, unaspirated [p] in <i>spay</i>. In Kashaya, <b>pʰ tʰ ṭʰ cʰ kʰ qʰ</b> are aspirated. <a target="_blank" href="sounds.html">↗️</a></p>
<p><a name="assertive"></a> <b>Assertive</b>. A special, minimal verb that consists of the consonant /ʔ/; it behaves as a <a href="#clitic" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">clitic</a> and can be followed by various suffixes. Between consonants, this /ʔ/ is realized as /i/. <a target="_blank" 
 href="assertive.html">↗️</a></p>
<p><a name="asterisk"></a> <b>Asterisk (*)</b>. The asterisk 
  symbol, or &quot;star&quot;, has a special function in the Kashaya database: it indicates a <a href="#bound" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">bound</a> <a href="#stem" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">stem</a> that cannot occur by itself. This is mainly an issue for verbs. Thus /*bimucid/ is the stem for &quot;eat&quot;, but in order to pronounce it as a word, it's necessary to add a suffix such as the Absolutive to make /bimuci·du/ &quot;to eat&quot;.<br>
        It also has two more conventional functions in linguistics; in a very 
  general sense, they both mean &quot;not verified&quot;. (<b>1</b>) In studying 
  the history of a language, linguists reconstruct ancient forms of words 
  (or individual sounds) based on available information, such as how words 
  are pronounced in descendent languages. Because the reconstructed word is 
  a hypothesis, not an actually attested form, it is preceded by the asterisk 
  to identify it as such. For example,  Kashaya /ʔahca/ &quot;house&quot; is thought to come from the Proto-Pomo word */ʔahka/, but this is based on comparison with related  words such as Eastern Pomo /ka/. (<b>2</b>) Outside of the discussion 
  of reconstructed forms, the asterisk means that something is ungrammatical, i.e. 
  not consistent with the practice of native speakers. For example, the English word 
  order <i>*dog the</i> is ungrammatical; it should 
  be <i> the dog</i>.</p>
<p><a name="bound form"></a> <b>Bound</b>. Describes an element of language, 
   a <a href="#morpheme" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">morpheme</a>, 
  that cannot be used independently as a word. In English, the suffix <i>-er</i> is bound because it can be used only with a stem, as in <i>teach-er</i>. In Kashaya, a root such as /wa/ &quot;go, walk&quot; has to occur with a suffix, as in /wa·du/ or /wa·law/, so that means it's bound: there's no word <i>wa</i> by itself.</p>
<p><a name="clitic"></a> <b>Clitic</b>. A short grammatical element that &quot;leans&quot; on an adjacent word. It is similar to a suffix but in some ways more like an independent word.</p>
<p><a name="diacritic"></a> <b>Diacritic</b>. A distinguishing mark added to a letter modifying 
  it in some way, such as the cedilla in French <i >&#231;</i> or the tilde in Spanish <i >&ntilde;</i>. In Kashaya spelling, this refers to the added marks in <b>ṭ š pʰ pʼ</b>.</p>
<p><a name="dialects"></a> <b>Dialects</b>. Mutually intelligible varieties 
  of a single language. Not used in linguistics with the informal meanings 
  &quot;unwritten language&quot; or &quot;nonstandard language.&quot;</p>
<p><a name="digraph"></a> <b>Digraph</b>. Two letters used to represent one 
  sound, such as <i >ph</i> for the sound [f]. 
  Kashaya spellings such as <b>c</b> and <b>š</b> are used  to avoid the need for digraphs like <i>ch</i> and <i>sh</i>, especially since <i>ch</i> can be confused with <b>cʰ</b>.</p>
<p><a name="ejective"></a> <b>Ejective</b>. Said of an obstruent sound pronounced with
  a strong release caused by raising the larynx. In Kashaya, <b>pʼ tʼ ṭʼ sʼ cʼ kʼ qʼ</b> are  ejectives. Can also be called glottalized, but that term  can be used with sonorants which are not ejectives. <a target="_blank" 
 href="sounds.html">↗️</a></p>
<p><a name="epenthesis"></a> <b>Epenthesis, epenthetic</b>. Insertion of a vowel, usually to help with pronunciation. In Kashaya, it occurs when there are too many consonants in a row. <a target="_blank" href="syllables.html">↗️</a></p>
<p><a name="feature"></a> <b>Feature, featural</b>. Terms referring to the 
  various <a href="#phonetic" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')"> phonetic</a> qualities which characterize a <a href="#phoneme" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')"> phoneme</a>, such as <a href="#voiced" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')"> voiced</a>, <a href="#aspirated" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')"> aspirated</a>, <a href="#vocalic" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')"> vocalic</a>. For example, the sounds [p] and [b] 
  differ only in their voicing feature. <a target="_blank" href="sounds.html">↗️</a></p>
<p><a name="geminate"></a><a name="gemination"></a> <b>Geminate</b>. A consonant that 
  is &quot;doubled&quot; in pronunciation; this property is called <i>gemination</i>. It is not common in Kashaya (or in English), but does occur in a few words such as /si·ṭóṭṭo/ &quot;robin&quot;. Other speakers have a different pronounciation that avoids the unusual geminate, /si·ṭóhṭo/.</p>
<p><a name="gloss"></a> <b>Gloss</b>. A translation of an individual 
  word, especially as part of a word-by-word translation to aid someone in 
  understanding a text in a foreign language.</p>
<p><a name="glottal stop"></a> <b>Glottal stop</b>. A stoppage and sudden 
  release of air through the glottis (vocal cords),  found in English <i >uh-oh</i>,
  or some pronunciations of <i >Hawai&#145;i</i>. Transcribed [&#660;] or sometimes as [’] or [‘]. This sound  is marginal in English but very common in Kashaya. It is easy to hear in words such as <b>hoʔo</b> &quot;tooth&quot; and <b>maʔa</b> &quot;food&quot;. It is trickier to hear at the beginning or end of a word, as in <b>ʔoho</b> &quot;fire&quot;, <b>meʔ</b> &quot;time&quot;, <b>ʔacaʔ</b> &quot;person&quot;, or before a consonant as in <b>maʔyul </b>&quot;only&quot; or <b>hoʔtʼo </b>&quot;head&quot;. <a target="_blank" href="sounds.html">↗️</a></p>
<p><a name="glottal stop"></a> <b>Glottalized</b>. A consonant sound that occurs together with an articulation similar to a glottal stop. Glottalized <a href="#sonorant" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">sonorants</a> in Kashaya are /mʔ nʔ lʔ wʔ yʔ/, and glottalized <a href="#obstruent" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">obstruents</a> (called <a href="#ejective" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">ejectives</a>) are /pʼ tʼ ṭʼ sʼ cʼ kʼ qʼ/. <a target="_blank" href="sounds.html">↗️</a></p>
<p><a name="ipa" id="ipa2"></a> <b>IPA</b>. The International Phonetic Alphabet,
  a standard set of phonetic symbols for transcribing any of the world's languages.
  In  Kashaya and other California languages,  symbols such as <b>c š ṭ</b> are not standard in IPA. The glottal stop symbol <b>ʔ</b> and the diacritics of <b>pʰ</b> and <b>pʼ</b> are the same  in IPA, however.</p>
<p><a name="length" id="length"></a><a name="long" id="length2"></a> <b>Length</b>. A property of a vowel that is pronounced longer, or drawn out, relative to a short vowel. Represented in Kashaya by putting a raised dot <b>·</b> after the vowel. This may be the only difference between two words, such as <b>ʔihya</b> &quot;wind&quot; and <b>ʔihya·</b> &quot;bone, strong&quot;, or <b>cadu</b> &quot;look&quot; and <b>ca·du</b> &quot;fly along&quot;. <a target="_blank" href="length.html">↗️</a></p>
<p><a name="mora"></a><a name="moraic"></a> <b>Mora, 
  moraic</b>. Terms referring to a measure of syllable weight. Light syllables, 
  with a short vowel, measure one mora (CV); heavy syllables, which might 
  contain a long vowel (CVV) or a coda consonant following a short vowel (CVC), 
  measure two moras. In Kashaya, heavy syllables (with two moras) are associated with stress or accent. <a target="_blank" href="syllables.html">↗️</a></p>
<p><a name="morpheme"></a><a name="morphemic"></a> <b>Morpheme, 
  morphemic</b>. Terms referring to the smallest meaningful units of speech. 
  English <i>teachers</i> consists of three morphemes, <i>teach</i>, <i>er</i>, 
  and <i>s</i>. Kashaya <b>libuta·du</b> &quot;whistling&quot; contains the stem /libut-/, durative /-ad/, and absolutive /-u/.</p>
<p><a name="orthography"></a> <b>Orthography</b>. A conventional writing system used for a specific language or dialect; for example, 
  English spelling or (more specifically) American English spelling. Kashaya uses an Americanist orthography, common for Native American languages.</p>
<p><a name="patient"></a> <b>Patient</b>. A participant who is seen as  undergoing some kind of change, or being affected by another participant, as in <i><span>We</span></i> <i>got sick</i>, or <i>She kicked <span>me</span></i>. In Kashaya, this role may be marked by the clitic <b>ʔel</b> or suffix <b>-l</b> or -<b>to</b>. Compare <a href="#agent" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">agent</a>. <a target="_blank" href="agent.html">↗️</a></p>
<p><a name="phoneme"></a><a name="phonemic" id="phonemic"></a> <b>Phoneme,
  phonemic</b>. Terms
  used in reference  to the smallest units of speech that distinguish one
  word from another.  Examples: the <i>b</i> and <i>p</i> of <i>bat</i> and <i>pat</i>.
  Can be  thought of, very roughly, as the abstract sound category represented
  by a letter (in most instances), Technically indicated by slashes //, rather than brackets
  [ ] which are more general in use. </p>
<p> <a name="phonetic"></a><a name="phonetics" id="phonetics"></a> <b>Phonetic</b>. Making reference
  to sounds in their physical realization, distinct from <a href="#phoneme" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')"> phonemic</a> Phonetic transcription represents the two [p] sounds in <i>pot</i> and <i>spot</i> differently, since the first is <a href="#aspirated" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')"> aspirated</a> and the latter is not. Phonemic representation is based on
  the premise that since the <i>p</i> in <i>pot</i> is predictably aspirated
  and  the <i>p</i> in <i>spot</i> is predictably unaspirated, there is no need
  to differentiate  them, because native speakers will always pronounce
  them correctly. But in Kashaya, /p/ and /pʰ/ are distinct phonemes.<br>
</p>
<p><a name="phonology"></a> <b>Phonetics</b>.
  Having to do with the study of speech sounds as they are articulated or
  perceived, as opposed to the more abstract patterning of sounds in linguistic
  systems, which is the domain of <a href="#phonology" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">phonology</a>. </p>
<p><a name="phonology"></a> <b>Phonology, phonological</b>.
  Having to do with  the study of speech sounds as they pattern in linguistic
  systems, as opposed to the study of sound articulation and perception,
  which is the domain of <a href="#phonetics" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">phonetics</a>. </p>
<p><a name="quality" id="quality"></a> <b>Quality</b>. Distinctions – usually among vowels – created by the position of the tongue and lips, such as the difference between /i/ and /e/. <a target="_blank" href="sounds.html">↗️</a></p>
<p><a name="quantity" id="vowelquality2"></a> <b>Quantity</b>. Distinctions  – usually among vowels –  due to how long the vowel is pronounced, as between /e/ and /e·/. Equivalent in meaning to <a href="#long">length</a>. Can also be applied to consonants, in which case it is related to the term <a href="#gemination">gemination</a>. <a target="_blank" href="length.html">↗️</a></p>
<p><a name="schwa"></a> <b>Schwa</b>. A brief indistinct sound, very common in English, found in words such as <i>sof<span>a</span>, <span>a</span>gain, t<span>o</span>day, syst<span>e</span>m, lem<span>o</span>n</i>. 
  Also  the symbol [&#601;] that represents 
  this sound. Schwa does not occur in Kashaya, and should be avoided to ensure correct pronunciation.</p>
<p><a name="segments"></a> <b>Segments, segmental phonemes</b>. Vowels and 
  consonants – that is, <a href="#phoneme" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')"> phonemes</a> other than such &quot;suprasegmental&quot; information as tones 
  and intonation. </p>
<p><a name="semantic"></a> <b>Semantic</b>. Related to meaning. </p>
<p><a name="sibilant" id="sibilant"></a> <b>Sibilant</b>. A fricative or affricate
  with a &quot;hissing&quot; sound, such as English s<i> z sh ch j.</i> These are
  the consonants after which the English  suffix <i>-s</i>, is written <i>-es</i> and pronounced with a <a href="#schwa" class="gloss" onClick="return popup(this, 'glossary')">schwa</a> vowel: <i>kiss-es, fizz-es, wish-es,  rich-es, judg-es</i>. The Kashaya sibilants are /s sʼ š c cʰ cʼ/.</p>
<p><a name="syllable"></a> <b>Syllable.</b> A grouping of a vowel with one or more consonants that may precede or follow the vowel. In Kashaya a syllable always starts with a consonant, has a short or long vowel, and optionally one (rarely two) consonants at the end. <a target="_blank" href="syllables.html">↗️</a></p>
<p><a name="transcription"></a> <b>Transcription</b>. A representation of 
  how a word is pronounced, regardless of how it might be written in the usual 
  orthography for the language. A phonetic alphabet is designed to serve as 
  an efficient means of transcribing any language. </p>
<p><a name="vocalic"></a> <b>Vocalic</b>. Of or having to do with vowels.</p>
<p><a name="voiced"></a> <b>Voiced</b>. Characterized by vibration of the 
  vocal cords. In English and Kashaya, all vowels and some consonants are voiced. Example: 
  voiced [b] in <i>ban</i> contrasts with voiceless [p] in <i>pan</i>. <a target="_blank" href="sounds.html">↗️</a></p>
